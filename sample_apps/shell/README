An interactive, stateful AJAX shell that runs Python code on the server.

Part of http://code.google.com/p/google-app-engine-samples/.

May be run as a standalone app or in an existing app as an admin-only handler.
Can be used for system administration tasks, as an interactive way to try out
APIs, or as a debugging aid during development.

The logging, os, sys, db, and users modules are imported automatically.

Interpreter state is stored in the datastore so that variables, function
definitions, and other values in the global and local namespaces can be used
across commands.

To use the shell in your app, copy shell.py, static/*, and templates/* into
your app's source directory. Then, copy the URL handlers from app.yaml into
your app.yaml.
