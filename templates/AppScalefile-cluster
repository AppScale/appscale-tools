# The deployment strategy (roles -> machines) that should be used in this
# AppScale deployment.
# The following is a sample layout for running everything on one machine:
 ips_layout:
 - master : 192.168.1.2
 - appengine: 192.168.1.2
 - database: 192.168.1.2
 - zookeeper: 192.168.1.2

# Alternatively, the following is a layout that separates everything onto
# four machines:
# ips_layout:
# - master : 192.168.1.2
# - appengine: 192.168.1.3
# - database: 192.168.1.4
# - zookeeper: 192.168.1.5

# The previous two layouts only have one instance of each role running, so if
# that machine fails, there is no backup to take its place. This layout uses
# eight machines to provide failure resiliency:
# ips_layout:
# - master : 192.168.1.2
# - appengine:
#   - 192.168.1.3
#   - 192.168.1.4
# - database:
#   - 192.168.1.5
#   - 192.168.1.6
# - zookeeper:  # zookeeper uses paxos, so it needs a majority up (hence 3)
#   - 192.168.1.7
#   - 192.168.1.8
#   - 192.168.1.9
