# The underlying cloud infrastructure to deploy AppScale over.
# Set this to 'ec2' if running on Amazon EC2, 'euca' if running on Eucalyptus,
# or 'gce' if running on Google Compute Engine.
infrastructure : 'ec2'

# The Amazon or Eucalyptus Machine Image (ami or emi) that has AppScale
# installed on it. When running on Google Compute Engine, set this to the name
# of the image you set when you ran 'gcutil addimage'.

# The instance type that should be used for all virtual machines in your
# AppScale deployment, if running in Amazon EC2 or Eucalyptus.

# AppScale deployment, if running in Google Compute Engine.

# The availability zone that should be used for all virtual machines in your
# AppScale deployment. If using persistent disks in your AppScale deployment,
# they should be in the same zone that you specify here.
zone : 'us-east-1b' # For Amazon EC2
#zone: 'us-central1-a' # For Google Compute Engine

# Whether or not the Datastore should be erased when AppScale starts up.
# This defaults to False, to persist your data across AppScale runs.
# Note that your data is only persisted if you are using non-ephemeral
# storage (EBS on EC2, and PD on GCE). This will also clear the taskqueue
# and search state.
#clear_datastore: True

# The AWS keyname that should be used for all machines in this AppScale
# deployment. This should refer to a keyname that does not already exist
# in your AWS account. By default, we randomly generate a keyname for you.
#keyname : 'appscalekey'

# The AWS security group name that should be used for all machines in this
# AppScale deployment. This should refer to a keyname that does not already
# exist in your AWS account. When running in Google Compute Engine, this is
# the name that will be used for the network and firewall that is created
# for your GCE instances. By default, we randomly generate a group for you.

# Whether or not increased output should be presented to standard output.
# We recommend setting this to True if you are encountering issues with
# AppScale and wish to see precisely where they are coming from.

# The location on your computer where an OAuth2.0 client ID for an installed
# application can be found, which enables the AppScale Tools to talk to Google

# The number of copies (replicas) of each piece of data stored in the
# specified database. By default, we determine the optimal value based
# on the number of virtual machines running the 'database' role, by the
# formula: min(# of database VMs, 3). Setting this value lower increases
# performance, at the cost of fault-tolerance, and vice-versa.
# n : 1

# The password that should be used for the flower web interface that displays
# information about Task Queue tasks.

# AppScale developers only: The location of an AppScale source tree on

# on the AppScale VMs. Useful to test changes on multiple VMs without
# needing to manually rsync code or rebundle images.
# scp : "~/appscale"

# AppScale developers only: Bypasses the usual prompt for a cloud
# username and password and uses a default set of values. Insecure for
# a production environment but acceptable for testing.
# test : True

# AppScale developers only: Removes all nameserver entries from /etc/resolv.conf
# on each VM running AppScale. This experimental flag may improve performance
# when resolving public IPs or public DNS is expensive (e.g., a heavily
# burdened Eucalyptus cloud).
# alter_etc_resolv : True

# The number of AppServers that should be used to host each Google App
# Engine application running in this deployment. By default, we start
# with one AppServer and dynamically scale up or down based on
# (1) the number of requests serviced and (2) the number of enqueued
# requests, but this setting can be used to turn off this autoscaling
# and instead use a statically defined number of AppServers.
# appengine : 3

# The maximum amount of memory (in megabytes) to use for each Google App Engine
# application running in this deployment. By default, we limit each app server
# to 400 MB of memory.

# Runs the following commands before starting the AppController on each machine.
