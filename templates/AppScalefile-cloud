# The underlying cloud infrastructure to deploy AppScale over.
# Set this to 'ec2' if running on Amazon EC2, 'euca' if running on Eucalyptus,
# or 'gce' if running on Google Compute Engine.
infrastructure : 'ec2'

# The Amazon or Eucalyptus Machine Image (ami or emi) that has AppScale
# installed on it. When running on Google Compute Engine, set this to the name
# of the image you set when you ran 'gcutil addimage'.
machine : 'ami-ABCDEFG'

# The instance type that should be used for all virtual machines in your
# AppScale deployment, if running in Amazon EC2 or Eucalyptus.

# The instance type that should be used for all virtual machines in your
# AppScale deployment, if running in Google Compute Engine.
gce_instance_type : 'n1-standard-1'

# The database that your Google App Engine applications will be backed by.
# Defaults to 'cassandra', but 'hypertable' is also supported.
table : 'cassandra'

# The AWS keyname that should be used for all machines in this AppScale
# deployment. This should refer to a keyname that does not already exist
# in your AWS account.
keyname : 'appscalekey'

# The AWS security group name that should be used for all machines in this
# AppScale deployment. This should refer to a keyname that does not already
# exist in your AWS account. When running in Google Compute Engine, this is
# the name that will be used for the network and firewall that is created
# for your GCE instances.

# Whether or not increased output should be presented to standard output.
# We recommend setting this to True if you are encountering issues with
# AppScale and wish to see precisely where they are coming from.
#verbose : True

# The minimum number of machines that should be used for your AppScale
# deployment.
min : 1

# The maximum number of machines that should be used for your AppScale
# deployment.
max : 1

# The location on your computer where an OAuth2.0 client ID for an installed
# application can be found, which enables the AppScale Tools to talk to Google
# Compute Engine on your behalf.

# The project number associated with your Google Compute Engine account, used
# to uniquely identify you when communicating with Google Compute Engine.

# The number of copies (replicas) of each piece of data stored in the
# specified database. By default, we determine the optimal value based
# on the number of virtual machines running the 'database' role, by the
# formula: min(# of database VMs, 3). Setting this value lower increases
# performance, at the cost of fault-tolerance, and vice-versa.
# n : 1

# AppScale developers only: The location of an AppScale source tree on
# the local filesystem, that should be used in place of what is present
# on the AppScale VMs. Useful to test changes on multiple VMs without
# needing to manually rsync code or rebundle images.
# scp : "~/appscale"

# AppScale developers only: Bypasses the usual prompt for a cloud
# username and password and uses a default set of values. Insecure for
# a production environment but acceptable for testing.
# test : True

# AppScale developers only: Removes all nameserver entries from /etc/resolv.conf
# on each VM running AppScale. This experimental flag may improve performance
# when resolving public IPs or public DNS is expensive (e.g., a heavily
# burdened Eucalyptus cloud).
# alter_etc_resolv : True

# The number of AppServers that should be used to host each Google App
# Engine application running in this deployment. By default, we start
# with one AppServer and dynamically scale up or down based on
# (1) the number of requests serviced and (2) the number of enqueued
# requests, but this setting can be used to turn off this autoscaling
# and instead use a statically defined number of AppServers.
