AppScale is a platform that allows users to deploy and host their 
own Google App Engine applications. It executes automatically over 
Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, Rackspace, Eucalyptus, CloudStack,
OpenStack, as well as Xen, VirtualBox, VMWare, and KVM. It has been
developed and is maintained by AppScale Systems, Inc., in Santa
Barbara, CA.

## AppScale Tools ##
AppScale Tools Version 1.12.0
from AppScale Systems, Inc.
http://www.appscale.com

This toolset automates the installation and manipulation of
the AppScale system. AppScale can be run as a cloud over 
Eucalyptus, EC2, or Google Compute Engine, over a virtualization
layer such as Xen or KVM, or directly on a non-virtualized cluster.

To install the tools run:

sudo bash debian/appscale_build.sh

This will remove any directories /usr/local/appscale-tools*
and install the tools in /usr/local/appscale-tools.
