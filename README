AppScale Tools Version 1.6.6
from AppScale Systems, Inc.
http://www.appscale.com

This toolset automates the installation and manipulation of
the AppScale system. AppScale can be run as a cloud over 
Eucalyptus or EC2, over a virtualization layer such as Xen,
or directly on a non-virtualized cluster.

To install the tools run:

sudo bash debian/appscale_build.sh

This will remove any directories /usr/local/appscale-tools*
and install the tools in /usr/local/appscale-tools.
