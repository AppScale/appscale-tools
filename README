AppScale Tools Version 1.4
from the UCSB RACELab 
http://appscale.cs.ucsb.edu

This toolset automates the installation and manipulation of
the AppScale system.  AppScale can be run as a cloud over 
Eucalyptus or EC2, over a virtualization layer such as Xen,
or directly on a non-virtualized cluster.

The USAGE and installation for the tools can be found here:
http://code.google.com/p/appscale/wiki/AppScale_Tools_Usage

To install the tools run:

sudo bash debian/appscale_build.sh

This will remove any directories /usr/local/appscale-tools*
and install the tools in /usr/local/appscale-tools.
If you wish to change the target location, change TOOL_HOME in 
Makefile.

Please put ${TOOL_HOME}/bin (/usr/local/appscale-tools-1.4/bin 
is the default) in your path to use the tool:

export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/appscale-tools/bin
