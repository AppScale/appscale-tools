##################################################
# The deployment strategy used in this AppScale deployment.
# Each service/role can run on one or multiple machines.
# Primary roles: master, compute, database, zookeeper
# Optional roles: loadbalancer, taskqueue, search

# For each role other than master you can specify multiple machines.
# Use the IPs of existing machines,
# or node-X notation if you want AppScale to start new machines on the
# Infrastructure of choice.
# A single node deployment:
ips_layout:
  -
    roles:
      - master
      - compute
      - database
      - zookeeper
    nodes: [1 | vm1_private_IP]

# A multi node deployment example. Within nodes, one can specify either
# the number of nodes desired (cloud deployment) or a list of IPs (cluster
# deployment). When running on a cloud, each role stanza can define a
# specific instance type to be used: if left unspecified, the global
# instance_type type will be used.
#
#ips_layout:
#  -
#    roles: master
#    nodes: [1 | vm1_private_IP]
#    disks: disk_1
#    instance_type : n1-standard-8
#  -
#    roles: compute
#    nodes: [1 | vm2_private_IP]
#    instance_type : n1-standard-4
#  -
#    roles: database   # Cassandra needs a quorum to answer queries (hence 3)
#    nodes: [3 | [vm3_private_IP, vm4_private_IP, vm5_private_IP]]
#    disks: [disk_1, disk_2, disk_3]
#    instance_type : n1-standard-16
#  -
#    roles: zookeeper  # Zookeeper needs a majority of peers online (hence 3)
#    nodes: [3 | [vm6_private_IP, vm7_private_IP, vm8_private_IP]]

# A slightly more complex multi node with multiple roles on nodes.
#ips_layout:
#  -
#    roles: master
#    nodes: [1 | vm1_private_IP]
#  -
#    roles: compute, database
#    nodes: [3 | [vm3_private_IP, vm4_private_IP, vm5_private_IP]]
#  -
#    roles: zookeeper  # Zookeeper needs a majority of peers online (hence 3)
#    nodes: [3 | [vm6_private_IP, vm7_private_IP, vm8_private_IP]]


# Login is used to instruct AppScale which one is the visible public IP used
# by clients to connect. It could be the public IP of the master/load-balancer
# instance, or it could be the IP used for external load-balancer.

#############################################
############ Optional Parameters ############
#############################################

# The number of data replicas for this deployment. A value of 3 or 5 is
# recommended for production settings.
# By default, this value is set to 1.
#replication : 3

# The max number of machines that can be used for your AppScale deployment.
# Supported only in the Public Clouds above.
# By default, it is the number of distinct nodes specified in the ips_layout
# section.
#max_machines : 1

# The number of AppServer instances that serve application requests.
# By default, we start with two AppServer instances for high availability
# and dynamically scale up/down based on the number of application requests.
#default_min_appservers : 3

# The maximum amount of memory (in MB) an AppServer instance can use.
# By default, we limit each AppServer instance to 400MB.
#default_max_appserver_memory: 400

# The password that will be used for the Flower web interface to monitor task
# queues.
# By default, this value is set to 'appscale'.

############ For Devs Only ############
#######################################

# Whether or not increased output should be presented to standard output.
# We recommend setting this to True if you are encountering issues with
# AppScale and wish to see precisely where they are coming from.
#verbose : True

# AppScale developers only: Bypasses the usual prompt for a cloud
# username and password and uses a default set of values. Insecure for
# a production environment but acceptable for testing.
#test : True
