########## Virtual Machine (VM) Layout ###########
##################################################
# The deployment strategy used in this AppScale deployment.
# Each service/role can run on one or multiple machines.
# Primary roles: master, compute, database, zookeeper
# Optional roles: loadbalancer, taskqueue, search

# For each role other than master you can specify multiple machines.
# Use the IPs of existing machines,
# or node-X notation if you want AppScale to start new machines on the
# Infrastructure of choice.
# A single node deployment:
ips_layout:
  -
    roles:
      - master
      - compute
      - database
      - zookeeper
    nodes: [1 | vm1_private_IP]

# A multi node deployment.
#ips_layout:
#  -
#    roles: master
#    nodes: [1 | vm1_private_IP]
#    disks: disk_1
#  -
#    roles: compute
#    nodes: [1 | vm2_private_IP]
#  -
#    roles: database   # Cassandra needs a quorum to answer queries (hence 3)
#    nodes: [3 | [vm3_private_IP, vm4_private_IP, vm5_private_IP]]
#    disks: [disk_1, disk_2, disk_3]
#  -
#    roles: zookeeper  # Zookeeper needs a majority of peers online (hence 3)
#    nodes: [3 | [vm6_private_IP, vm7_private_IP, vm8_private_IP]]

# A slightly more complex multi node with multiple roles on nodes.
#ips_layout:
#  -
#    roles: master
#    nodes: [1 | vm1_private_IP]
#  -
#    roles: compute, database
#    nodes: [3 | [vm3_private_IP, vm4_private_IP, vm5_private_IP]]
#  -
#    roles: zookeeper  # Zookeeper needs a majority of peers online (hence 3)
#    nodes: [3 | [vm6_private_IP, vm7_private_IP, vm8_private_IP]]


# Login is used to instruct AppScale which one is the visible public IP used
# by clients to connect. It could be the public IP of the master/load-balancer
# instance, or it could be the list of IPs used for external load-balancers.
#login : [vm1_public_IP | Domain Name]

############ Optional Parameters ############
#############################################

# The number of data replicas for this deployment. A value of 3 or 5 is
# recommended for production settings.
# By default, this value is set to 1.
#replication : 3

# The max number of machines that can be used for your AppScale deployment.

############ For Devs Only ############
#######################################

# Whether or not increased output should be presented to standard output.
# We recommend setting this to True if you are encountering issues with
# AppScale and wish to see precisely where they are coming from.
#verbose : True

# AppScale developers only: Bypasses the usual prompt for a cloud
# username and password and uses a default set of values. Insecure for
# a production environment but acceptable for testing.
#test : True
