"""AppScale Tools, a command-line interface to the AppScale cloud platform.

The AppScale Tools provide users with a way to start, stop, and control their
AppScale deployments. The Tools can be used anywhere you can run Python 2.7,
and can be used to deploy AppScale over virtualized clusters (e.g., VirtualBox,
Xen, KVM) or cloud infrastructures (e.g., Amazon EC2, Eucalyptus).
